This is an elf infector based on Silvio's algorithm with some extra things.
You can edit parasite.h to put your data. The data can be extract using ./extra elf-program -o save.txt.

Here's an example to hide an image into the program called program-to-injected

1. convert image to shellcode string.
hexdump -v -e '"\\""x" 1/1 "%02x" ""' a.png > shellcode

(encrypted shellcode string (do it later))

2. copy shellcode string to parasite.h.

3. injecting data to program
./injector program-to-injected

4. extract data from injected program (data is hide in the end of .eh_frame). This program will only work 
on non-stripped and infected binaries 
python extract_data.py program-to-injected save.jpg

Still in process...
